  title: Elevator Call API 2.0
  version: v2
  description: >

    With Elevator Call API you can implement elevator call-giving features in
    the applications of your choice. Through Elevator Call API, an application
    can execute elevator calls and receive real-time data about the call and the
    assigned elevator.


    ## Usage example: lift-call


    1. Acquire accessToken


    2. Open WebSocket connection



    ```

    const ws = new
    WebSocket(`wss://dev.kone.com/stream-v2?accessToken=${accessToken}`,
    'koneapi')


    ```

    3. Within the connection, make the lift-call


    ``` const liftCallPayload = {
       type: 'lift-call-api-v2',
       buildingId: 'building:9990000951',
       callType: 'action',
       groupId: '1',
       payload: {
         request_id: 252390420,
         area: 3000,
         time: '2020-10-10T07:17:33.298515Z',
         terminal: 1,
         call: { 
           action: 2, 
           destination: 5000 
         }
      }
    } 

    ws.send(JSON.stringify(liftCallPayload))

    ws.on('message', (data: any) => {
      // message received from the device
    })

    ```

    #### Additional information:

    The websocket connection will be automatically disconnect after 60 seconds
    of inactivity. And after 2 hours even it has been active.

        Each elevator call request is linked to a certain WebSocket connection
        and this link is automatically cut off once the connection is closed.
        Use the create-session request to receive a new sessionId needed for
        reactivating a lost connection. Once a new connection is established,
        create-session or below explained resume-session should be the first
        requests made.

    resume-session:
      description: >
        Use the resume-session request to reactivate a previously created
        session. The new connection will assume ownership of the previous
        sessions, active requests and new events related to requests made
        earlier. You can also receive latest state messages relevant to a
        session. To prevent a potential session theft, authentication token with
        matching application and user ID (when present) are needed when resuming
        a session. There can only be one active session at once in one
        connection. In case there is an open connection linked to the session,
        the previous connection is immediately closed.

        Response status codes should be interpreted as in the HTTP

        Create a destination lift call. A destination call sets both the

        information found from the building config action

        The default behavior for calls is to close the connection after the
        client is not expecting any more state events from the call. If the
        client does not specify any monitoring events, the connection will be
        closed after receiving the response. If client needs to create
        consecutive calls it can specify keepAlive flag to keep the connection
        open for up to two hours.

        Response status codes should be interpreted as in the HTTP
        specification: 201 - Call has been registered to the system. 400 - Call
        payload validation error. 401 - Not authenticated or token expired. 403
        - Client is forbidden from performing the request. Please check the
        provided scopes. 404 - Invalid building id. 409 - Conflicting request.
        Eg. requestId not unique within the connection. 500 - Internal error.

        lift car one whole floor at a time, requiring separate state-events for 

        each update, and suffering from delivery lag. Essentially, for UI
        purposes 

        this event should be much better than Lift deck position.
